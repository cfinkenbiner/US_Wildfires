# Wildfire Severity Prediction using USA NASA Soils and Vegetation Datasets 

## Research Problem:
Climate change has increased the risk of wildfires in the Western United States by creating warmer, drier conditions, increasing drought severity and extending the fire season. The probability of wildfire occurrence and the severity of wildfires depends on numerous influencing factors including air temperature, soil moisture, type of vegetation and potential fuel. 

## Objective: 
Use relevant data (i.e. soil type, vegetation classification) at each site location where a wildfire has occurred to predict the probability of wildfire occurrence and the severity of wildfires using machine learning techniques (e.g. regression, classification, etc.). 

## Research Questions:
1) Can site location (latitude, longitude), soil type, vegetation and other relevant information be used to predict the likelihood of fire occurrence in the Western US? 
2) 2) Can site location (latitude, longitude), soil type, vegetation and other relevant information be used to predict the severity of wildfires in the Western US? 3) Can this information be used to predict future trends in wildfire severity and occurrence, assuming climate change continues at the current rate?
 
## Datasets: 
1) a relatively large (800 MB) wildfire dataset containing ~188 million wildfire records from 1992 - 2015
2) 2) NASA Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) vegetation dataset (14-class UMD map at 1-km; 5MB)
3) 3) NLDAS soil type dataset (1-km Penn State STATSGO data and have 16 texture types; 5MB)
* Other available datasets may be used within this analysis. 

First, this work will analyze Oregon wildfires and then apply the developed methods to other western US states. I will produce a methods, tools and datasets that can be used for current fire monitoring and prediction and applied toward informed land management and decision making. I plan to provide a QGIS dataset where a user can interact with the data and models and well as an open source juptyer notebook executing all code and reproducing all visualizations.
